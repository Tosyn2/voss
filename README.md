# My First Python and Flask App

A currency converter as a fulfilment for a tech assessment.

## Installation Process

1. git clone https://github.com/cornelous/voss.git
2. Open a terminal and run:-

    (a) pin install    
    (b) php artisan migrate
    (c) export FLASK_ENV=development
    (d) flask run

3. Visit app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
## NB
This is my very first python and flask, I enjoyed the experience of
putting it together. I still have lots to learn!

My unit tests are incomplete, I was going to test for these 3 scenarios
- test that non-supported currencies can not be submitted
- test that given a base and a target, a number is returned 
- test that EUR to EUR conversion fails as this is NOT supported by API
